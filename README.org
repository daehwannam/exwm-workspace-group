* EXWM Workspace Group
  An EXWM extension for managing workspace units in a multiple monitor environment by grouping the units

** Configuration
   #+begin_src elisp
   (require 'exwm-workspace-group)
   (ewg/init (list "HDMI-1-1" "DVI-I-1" "HDMI-0"))  ; pass a list of connected monitor names found by xrandr
   #+end_src

** Note
   - Each workspace in the current group corresponds to each monitor
   - You can create, delete or switch between groups
   - Currently, it supports only dual and triple monitor configurations
     - However, you can easily define your own ~ewg/xrandr-*-monitor~ and modify ~ewg/init~
   - ~ewg/init~ modifies values of some variables defined in ~exwm~ package:
     - ~exwm-workspace-number~
     - ~exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist~
     So, be careful of conflicts with your existing EXWM configuration.
   - Interactive functions
     - ~ewg/add-group~
     - 
     - ~ewg/switch-next-group~
     - ~ewg/switch-previous-group~
     - ~ewg/other-workspace-in-group~
     - ~ewg/other-workspace-in-group-backwards~
     - ~ewg/swap-current-group-number~
   - You can also switch to a specific group by using ~ewg/switch-create~ instead of ~exwm-workspace-switch-create~
     #+begin_src elisp
     ;; This exampmle is modified from https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki#global-key-bindings
     (setq exwm-input-global-keys
           `(;; ...
             ;; other bindings here
             ;; ...
             ,@(mapcar (lambda (i)
                         `(,(kbd (format "s-%d" i)) .
                           (lambda ()
                             (interactive)
                             (ewg/switch-create ,i))))
                       (number-sequence 0 9))))
     #+end_src
   - ~exwm-workspace-group~ is also compatible with ~tab-bar-mode~

** Limitation
   Functions ~ewg/delete-current-group~ and ~ewg/delete-other-groups~ are implemented to delete groups.
   However, many deletions of workspaces cause the following error: "Attempt to delete a surrogate minibuffer frame"
